Make quiz interface:
1. Get quiz data through ajax

2. Make a clean interface for each quiz type
	.TestQuestion	— done
	.GroupSort	— drag drop
	.PairMatching	— click the correct for current one
	.PutInOrder	— drag drop ?
	.FillMissingWords	— drag drop
	.TermToDef	— click pair consecutively

3. Make loading task data on interface for each type

4. Make getting answer and sending it to the table (add task type column and AnswerScore column)
Question is answered when:
	.TestQuestion	— an option is clicked
	.GroupSort	— all items are dragged into groups
	.PairMatching	— all questions are answered. the chosen answer gets banished if correct and stays if incorrect
	.PutInOrder	— all sentence elements are dragged into container (I guess we will use spans as draggables)
	.FillMissingWords	— words are dragged to all empty spaces
	.TermToDef	— show how many pairs are there, then when so many pairs are linked

5. Show right answer
	.TestQuestion	— wrong student answer is red, correct is green
	.GroupSort	— AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	.PairMatching	— like... show each after each answer?
	.PutInOrder	— just show right answer
	.FillMissingWords	— wrong ones are red, right ones are green
	.TermToDef	— just show right answer
